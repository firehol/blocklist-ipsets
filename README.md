# About this repo

This repository includes a list of ipsets dynamically updated with
firehol's (https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol) `update-ipsets.sh`
script found [here](https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/blob/master/contrib/update-ipsets.sh).

This repo is self maintained. It it updated automatically from the script via a cron job.

## Why do we need blocklists?

As time passes and the internet matures in our life, cyber crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated.
Although there many tools (detection of malware, viruses, intrusion detection and prevension systems, etc)
to help us isolate the budguys, there are now a lot more than just such attacks.

What is more interesting is that the fraudsters or attackers in many cases are not going to do a
direct damage to you or your systems. They will use you and your systems to gain something else,
possibly not related or indirectly related to your business. Nowdays the attacks cannot be identified easily. They are
distributed and come to our systems from a vast amount of IPs around the world.

To get an idea, check for example the [XRumer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRumer) software. This think mimics human
behaviour to post ads, it creates email accounts, responds to emails it receives, bypasses captchas, it goes gently
to stay unoticed, etc.

To increase our effectiveness we need to complement our security solutions with our 
shared knowledge, our shared experience in this fight.

Hopefully, there are many teams out there that do their best to identify the attacks and pinpoint
the attackers. These teams release blocklists. Blocklists of IPs (for use in firewalls), domains & URLs
(for use in proxies), etc.

What we are interested here is IPs.

Using IP blocklists at the internet side of your firewall is a key component of internet security.
These lists share key knowledge between us, allowing us to learn from each other and effectively
isolate fraudsters and attackers from our services.

I decided to upload these lists to a github repo because:

1. They are freely available on the internet. The intention of their creators is to help internet security.
 Keep in mind though that a few of these lists may have special licences attached. Before using them, please
 check their source site for any information regarding proper use.

2. Github provides (via `git pull`) a unified way of updating all the lists together.
 Pulling this repo regularly on your machines, you will update all the IP lists at once.

3. Github also provides a unified version control. Using it we can have a history of what each list has done,
 which IPs or subnets were added and which were removed.

## DNSBLs

Check also another tool included in FireHOL v3+, called `dnsbl-ipset.sh`.

This tool is capable of creating an ipset based on your traffic by looking up information on DNSBLs and scoring it according to your preferences.

More information [here](https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/dnsbl-ipset.sh).

# Using these ipsets
Please be very careful what you choose to use and how you use it.
If you blacklist traffic using these lists you may end up blocking
your users, your customers, even yourself (!) from accessing your
services.

1. Goto to the site of each list and read how each list is maintained. You are going to trust these guys for doing their job right.

2. Most sites have either a donation system or commercial lists of higher quality. Try to support them. 

3. I have included the TOR network in these lists (`danmetor`, `tor`, `tor_servers`). The TOR network is not necessarily bad and you should not block it if you want to allow your users be anonymous. I have included it because for certain cases, allowing an anonymity network might be a risky thing (such as eCommerce).

4. Apply any blacklist at the internet side of your firewall. Be very carefull. The `bogons` and `fullbogons` lists contain private, unroutable IPs that should not be routed on the internet. If you apply such a blocklist on your DMZ or LAN side, you will be blocked out of your firewall.

5. Always have a whitelist too, containing the IP addresses or subnets you trust. Try to build the rules in such a way that if an IP is in the whitelist, it should not be blocked by these blocklists.

## Using them in FireHOL

### Adding the ipsets in your firehol.conf

I use something like this. Keep in mind that you have to have the `whitelist` ipset created before all these.
iptables will log each match, together with the name of the ipset that matched the packet.

```sh
	# our wan interface
	wan="dsl0"
	
	# our whitelist
	ipset4 create whitelist hash:net
	ipset4 add whitelist A.B.C.D/E # A.B.C.D/E is whitelisted
	
	# subnets
	for x in fullbogons dshield spamhaus_drop spamhaus_edrop
	do
		ipset4 create  ${x} hash:net
		ipset4 addfile ${x} ipsets/${x}.netset
		blacklist4 full inface "${wan}" log "BLACKLIST ${x^^}" ipset:${x} \
			except src ipset:whitelist
	done

	# individual IPs
	for x in zeus feodo palevo autoshun openbl blocklist_de malc0de ciarmy \
		malwaredomainlist snort_ipfilter stop_forum_spam_1h stop_forum_spam_7d \
		bruteforceblocker rosi_connect_proxies rosi_web_proxies compromised
	do
		ipset4 create  ${x} hash:ip
		ipset4 addfile ${x} ipsets/${x}.ipset
		blacklist4 full inface "${wan}" log "BLACKLIST ${x^^}" ipset:${x} \
			except src ipset:whitelist
	done

	... rest of firehol.conf ...
```

### Updating the ipsets while the firewall is running

Just use the `update-ipsets.sh` script from the firehol distribution.
This script will update each ipset and call firehol to update the ipset while the firewall is running.

Keep in mind that you have to use the `update-ipsets.sh` script before activating the firewall, so that the ipsets exist on disk.

# List of ipsets included

The following list was automatically generated on Mon May 25 23:37:11 UTC 2015.

The update frequency is the maximum allowed by internal configuration. A list will never be downloaded sooner than the update frequency stated. A list may also not be downloaded, after this frequency expired, if it has not been modified on the server (as reported by HTTP `IF_MODIFIED_SINCE` method).
