# About this repo

This repository includes a list of ipsets dynamically updated with
firehol's (https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol) `update-ipsets.sh`
script.

Using blocklists at the internet side of your firewall is a key component of internet security.
These lists share key knowledge between us, allowing us to learn from each other and effectively
isolate fraudsters and attackers from our services.

I decided to upload these lists to a github repo because:

1. They are freely available on the internet. The intention of their creators is to help internet security.
 Keep in mind though that a few of these lists may have special licences attached. Before using them, please
 check their source site for any information regarding proper use.

2. Github provides (via `git pull`) a unified way of updating all the lists together. Pulling this repo regularly on your machines, you will update all the IP lists at once.

3. Github also provides a unified version control. Using it we can have a history of what each list has done, which IPs or subnets were added and which were removed.

# Using these ipsets
Please be very careful what you choose to use and how you use it.
If you blacklist traffic using these lists you may end up blocking
your users, your customers, even yourself (!) from accessing your
services.

1. Goto to the site of each list and read how each list is maintained. You are going to trust these guys for doing their job right.

2. Most sites have either a donation system or commercial lists of higher quality. Try to support them. 

3. I have included the TOR network in these lists (`danmetor`, `tor`, `tor_servers`). The TOR network is not necessarily bad and you should not block it if you want to allow your users be anonymous. I have included it because for certain cases, allowing an anonymity network might be a risky thing (such as eCommerce).

4. Apply any blacklist at the internet side of your firewall. Be very carefull. The `bogons` and `fullbogons` lists contain private, unroutable IPs that should not be routed on the internet. If you apply such a blocklist on your DMZ or LAN side, you will be blocked out of your firewall.

5. Always have a whitelist too, containing the IP addresses or subnets you trust. Try to build the rules in such a way that if an IP is in the whitelist, it should not be blocked by these blocklists.
