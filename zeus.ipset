#
# [Abuse.ch Zeus tracker] (https://zeustracker.abuse.ch) 
# standard, contains the same data as the ZeuS IP blocklist 
# (zeus_badips) but with the slight difference that it 
# doesn't exclude hijacked websites (level 2) and free web 
# hosting providers (level 3). This means that this blocklist 
# contains all IPv4 addresses associated with ZeuS C&Cs which 
# are currently being tracked by ZeuS Tracker. Hence this 
# blocklist will likely cause some false positives.
