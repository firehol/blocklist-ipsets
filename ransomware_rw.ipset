# [Abuse.ch Ransomware Tracker] 
# (https://ransomwaretracker.abuse.ch) Ransomware Tracker 
# tracks and monitors the status of domain names, IP 
# addresses and URLs that are associated with Ransomware, 
# such as Botnet C&C servers, distribution sites and payment 
# sites. By using data provided by Ransomware Tracker, 
# hosting- and internet service provider (ISPs), as well as 
# national CERTs/CSIRTs, law enforcement agencies (LEA) and 
# security researchers can receive an overview on 
# infrastructure used by Ransomware and whether these are 
# actively being used by miscreants to commit fraud. This 
# list includes TC_PS_IPBL, LY_C2_IPBL, TL_C2_IPBL, 
# TL_PS_IPBL and it is the recommended blocklist. It might 
# not catch everything, but the false positive rate should be 
# low. However, false positives are possible, especially with 
# regards to RW_IPBL. IP addresses associated with Ransomware 
# Payment Sites (*_PS_IPBL) or Locky botnet C&Cs (LY_C2_IPBL) 
# stay listed on RW_IPBL for a time of 30 days after the last 
# appearance. This means that an IP address stays listed on 
# RW_IPBL even after the threat has been eliminated (e.g. the 
# VPS / server has been suspended by the hosting provider) 
# for another 30 days.
