#
# [Abuse.ch SSL Blacklist] (https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) The 
# aggressive version of the SSL IP Blacklist contains all IPs 
# that SSLBL ever detected being associated with a malicious 
# SSL certificate. Since IP addresses can be reused (e.g. 
# when the customer changes), this blacklist may cause false 
# positives. Hence I highly recommend you to use the standard 
# version instead of the aggressive one.
