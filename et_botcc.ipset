# [EmergingThreats.net Command and Control 
# IPs](http://doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/BotCC) 
# These IPs are updates every 24 hours and should be 
# considered VERY highly reliable indications that a host is 
# communicating with a known and active Bot or Malware 
# command and control server - (although they say this 
# includes abuse.ch trackers, it does not - most probably it 
# is the shadowserver.org C&C list)
