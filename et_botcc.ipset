# [EmergingThreats.net Command and Control IPs] 
# (http://doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/BotCC) These 
# IPs are updates every 24 hours and should be considered 
# VERY highly reliable indications that a host is 
# communicating with a known and active Bot or Malware 
# command and control server - (although they say this 
# includes abuse.ch trackers, it does not - check its 
# overlaps)
