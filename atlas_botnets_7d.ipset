# [ATLAS Botnets] (https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/botnets) - 
# Botnets are collections of compromised hosts that attackers 
# remotely control for their own nefarious purposes. Once 
# installed and running, a malicious bot will attempt to 
# connect to a remote server to receive instructions on what 
# actions to take. The most common command and control (C&C) 
# protocol used for this is Internet Relay Chat (IRC). While 
# a legitimate protocol for online chat, IRC is often used by 
# attackers due to the relative simplicity of the protocol 
# along with the ready availability of bot software written 
# to use it. After connecting, a bot-controlled host can be 
# controlled by an attacker and commanded to conduct 
# malicious actions such as sending spam, scanning the 
# Internet for other potentially controllable hosts, or 
# launching DoS attacks. ATLAS maintains a real-time database 
# of malicious botnet command and control servers that is 
# continuously updated. This information comes from malware 
# analysis, botnet infiltration, and other sources of data.
