# [ATLAS Fastflux] (https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/fastflux) 
# - Fast flux hosting is a technique where the nodes in a 
# botnet are used as the endpoints in a website hosting 
# scheme. The DNS records change frequently, often every few 
# minutes, to point to new bots. The actual nodes themselves 
# simply proxy the request back to the central hosting 
# location. This gives the botnet a robust hosting 
# infrastructure. Many different kinds of botnets use 
# fastflux DNS techniques, for malware hosting, for illegal 
# content hosting, for phishing site hosting, and other such 
# activities. These hosts are likely to be infected with some 
# form of malware.
