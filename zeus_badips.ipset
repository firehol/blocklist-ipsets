# [Abuse.ch Zeus tracker] (https://zeustracker.abuse.ch) 
# badips includes IPv4 addresses that are used by the ZeuS 
# trojan. It is the recommened blocklist if you want to block 
# only ZeuS IPs. It excludes IP addresses that ZeuS Tracker 
# believes to be hijacked (level 2) or belong to a free web 
# hosting provider (level 3). Hence the false postive rate 
# should be much lower compared to the standard ZeuS IP 
# blocklist.
