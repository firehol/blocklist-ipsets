# MaxMind Geolite2

[MaxMind GeoLite2](http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) databases
are free IP geolocation databases comparable to, but less accurate than,
MaxMindâ€™s GeoIP2 databases. GeoLite2 databases are updated on the first
Tuesday of each month.

## Country ipset

MaxMind distinguishes between several types of country data. The `country` is the country where the IP
address is located. The `registered_country` is the country in which the IP is registered.
These two may differ in some cases.

They also include a `represented_country` key for some records. This is used when the IP address belongs
to something like a military base. The `represented_country` is the country that the base represents.
This can be useful for managing content licensing, among other uses.

**In the ipsets generated, an IP subnet is added to all `country`, `registered_country` and `represented_country`
(of course only when these differ).**

## Continent ipsets

MaxMind provides the continent each IP subnet is located. Using this information we created the `geolite2/continent_*.netset` ipsets.


## Global providers

MaxMind provides two flags for each IP subnet.

- `A1` which stands for `is anonymous provider`
- `A2` which stands for `is satellite provider`

Using this information we created two additional ipsets: `geolite2/anonymous.netset` and `geolite2/satellite.netset`.
