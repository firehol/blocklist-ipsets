# Ponmocup. The malware powering the botnet has been around 
# since 2006 and itâ€™s known under various names, including 
# Ponmocup, Vundo, Virtumonde, Milicenso and Swisyn. It has 
# been used for ad fraud, data theft and downloading 
# additional threats to infected systems. Ponmocup is one of 
# the largest currently active and, with nine consecutive 
# years, also one of the longest running, but it is rarely 
# noticed as the operators take care to keep it operating 
# under the radar.
