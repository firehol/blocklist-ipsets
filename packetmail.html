<p>This IP list includes IP addresses that have been detected performing TCP SYN to 206.82.85.196/30 to a non-listening service or daemon.

<strong><big>This IP list may suffer from poisoning!</big></strong><br/>
<p>Since the maintainers do no verification at all on the received SYN packets, anyone can easily send spoofed SYN packets to 206.82.85.196/30 to have any IP he/she likes listed!</p>
<p>Ideally they should have be using <a href="https://github.com/ktsaou/firehol/wiki/Working-with-SYNPROXY" target="_blank">SYNPROXY</a> to verify the source IP addresses of packets.</p>
